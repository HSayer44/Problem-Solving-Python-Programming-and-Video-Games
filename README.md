# Problem Solving Python Programming and Video Games

This course is an introduction to computer science and programming in Python
an online non-credit course authorized by University of Alberta and offered through
Coursera.
There are two games you have to develop:
# Hacking:
This is a graphical password guessing game that displays a
list of potential computer passwords. The player is allowed
up to 4 attempts to guess the password. Each time the user
guesses incorrectly, the number of correct letters in their
correct locations is displayed and the user is prompted to
make a new guess. The game indicates whether the player
successfully guessed the password or not.

# Poke The Dots:
This is a graphical game where two dots move around
the screen, bouncing off the edges. The user tries 
to prevent the dots from colliding by pressing and 
releasing the mouse button or pressing 'p' key to teleport the dots to 
a random location. The score is the number of seconds 
from the start of the game.
